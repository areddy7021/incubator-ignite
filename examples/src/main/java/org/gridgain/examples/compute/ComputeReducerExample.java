/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of GridGain grid with reduce closure.
 * <p>
 * Phrase is split into words and distributed across Grid nodes where length of each word is
 * calculated. Then total phrase length is calculated using reducer.
 * <p>
 * Remote nodes should always be started with special configuration file which
 * enables P2P class loading: {@code 'ggstart.{sh|bat} examples/config/example-compute.xml'}.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively you can run {@link ComputeNodeStartup} in another JVM which will start GridGain node
 * with {@code examples/config/example-compute.xml} configuration.
